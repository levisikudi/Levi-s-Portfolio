### Introduction

This app is essentially an App for cat owners who feel like their furry feline friends are not spending enough time with their species. The app allows you to connect with other cat owners in your area and set up 'cat dates' for them. It has a search and chat functionality that is feline-centric ; if we could, we would let the cats operate it themselves! Humans in this case are just the intermediary. As per now it is on v1 with only its most basic functionalities up and running.

### Technology

Catnip uses React functional components in much of its front end functionalities.
It heavily uses Bootsrap in styling with some basic overides being done by CSS3
For authentification, it utilizes Passport, more specifically passport-local
It uses an external API (Cloudinary) to host images.
On the backend, it uses Node.js as a runtime, MongoDB as it's designated database and Express to handle server to database calls.
Lastly, the app uses Render as its hosting service

### Getting Started

The app can be found on [https://catnip-151h.onrender.com]

### `Unsolved Issues`

Right now, for updated results to be seen, one has to log out then log back in. It is probably an issue to do with routing, and I am currently working on it.
Additionally, the chat functionality still has not been built. I am making sure that I firstly get all the routes in order before I move on to the next phase.

### Future Enhancements

They include, finishing up the main product. Testing it in the field, then slowly offering it up to the public if the demand is high.
